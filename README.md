# Word-Mover-s-Distance

The project consists of writing and comparing different methods of distance calculation between documents. Distances calculation methods are described in the fourth section of the following article.
Kusner et al., 2015 - http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/kusnerb15.pdf

The written methods are as follows :
- Word centroid distance (WCD) between 2 documents
- Relaxed word moving distance (RWMD) between 2 documents
- Exact WMD via Prefetch and prune to find the k-nearest neighbors of an input sentence within a collection of reference sentences.

WCD and RWMD are tested in the following sentences : "Obama speaks to the media in Illinois" and "The President greets the press in Chicago." 
In order to compare other sentences, the chosen ones can be changed.
